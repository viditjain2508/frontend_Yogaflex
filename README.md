## Implementation Details

This section provides insights into the technical aspects of YogaFlex:

- **Basic Validations:** Implemented through input taken using login/register functionalities.
- **API Handling:** Manages data such as user enrollment, payment status, batch change requests, etc.
- **APIs Implemented:**
  - `batchChangeReq`: Handles batch change requests from users.
  - `makePayment`: Processes user payments.
  - `checkPaymentStatus`: Verifies the payment status of a user.
  - `login` and `signup`: APIs for user authentication.

- **Payment and Batch Change Logic:**
  - **Payment Processing:** Utilizes the `CompletePayment()` mock/blackbox function.
  - **Batch Change:** Automatically executed as the new month begins using cron jobs.
  - **Account Deletion:** If a user fails to make a payment by the last date of the month, their account will be deleted.

These implementations ensure a smooth and efficient operation of YogaFlex, providing users with a hassle-free experience in managing their classes and payments.
